# Why Macroscopic Haptics First?
## Low Competition
Other teams seem to be interested in the gloves and the treadmill problems and tracking problems when I initally started this project in 2022. 
Between LucidVR gloves and its many spin-offs, and many more commercial attempts, It looked like the haptics problem on the scale of a few ounces was being addressed, but
my desired use case of haptics on the scale of a few pounds was being ignored. - alex
## Waltz needs connection
Waltz is frequently done lead through a physical connection, and vision is used to avoid other dancers on the dance floor. (at least when I'm dancing)
As of may 2024, I am under the impression that somewhere between 8 ounces and 8 lbs will be the appropriate amount of force.  - Alex
# Why Did I pivot towards Lag in November 2023?
So while I have not directly participated in a VR dance experience, I got the opportunity to Jam musically with a friend and a stranger in VRchat for my birthday.
This experience was WEIRD. I was playing a cahone in one room using a quest 2 or 3. My friend was in the next room IRL using a quest 2 or 3 but playing a piano in game. The stranger was playing his guitar and singing over his PC.
I think what happened is I played notes at one time, my friend played notes to my IRL audio, and the stranger played notes to both of us.
So from my perspective, both people were delayed. From my friend's perspective, he was playing in time and the stranger was delayed. From the stranger's perspective everyone was in time. This was fundamentally frustrating, and made me focus on Lag minimization and regularization for a bit. (regularization being my term for making the amount of lag a comprehendable musical interval)
# Why packet shredding first?
That was many of the zany ideas I had to deal with lag that I later came to realize was less useful under more realistic assumptions.
Because I had a collaborator whose skills were relevant to that Idea. -Alex
# Why a drone second?
While the first Idea for this huge project, I have returned to the drone because I have ideas for demos which don't require an entire VR system.
Because I had a collaborator whose skills were relevant to that Idea. -Alex
