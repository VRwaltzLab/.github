# Why Macroscopic Haptics First?
## Low Competition
Other teams seem to be interested in the gloves and the treadmill problems and tracking problems when I initally started this project in 2022. 
Between LucidVR gloves and its many spin-offs, and many more commercial attempts, It looked like the haptics problem on the scale of a few ounces was being addressed, but
my desired use case of haptics on the scale of a few pounds was being ignored. - alex
## Waltz needs connection
Waltz is frequently done lead through a physical connection, and vision is used to avoid other dancers on the dance floor. (at least when I'm dancing) - Alex
