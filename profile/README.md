# VRwaltzLab
## Purpose
In order to do good test driven development, an organization needs both a strong QA team and a strong Dev team. The VRwaltzLab aims to pull its QA expertise from Waltz, and its Dev expertise from VR to make an Accessible Immersive Waltz Experience by 2030.

## Commitments
In the theme of sharing joy, this project is committed to:
1. Solving the general problems VR has with waltz rather than just bringing waltz and nothing else into VR.
2. Physical Prototypes which are made in the standard of COTS parts for a DIY maker audience
3. Open Source, Modular, and Repairable Hardware
4. Open Source, and Interpretable Software
5. Inclusive and Expressive rather than Pricey or Prescriptive Dance Spaces
6. Pay what you want Music with master files available.
7. A Patronage and Support as a Service Revenue Model
8. Co-op Cost and Pay Model once(if) money is involved. Work trading model before then.

## Motivation
The founderâ€™s core motivation is to do some hard math research which facilitates the sharing of joy. I want to build some robots, and I want to write some high performance algorithms.

## What is waltz?
For people unfamiliar with waltz, this project is focused on the following properties of the experience:
1- Social 2- Partner-based 3- Physical 4- musical experience of a 5- spinning 6- traveling
7- improvised 8- signaled rather than called dance.
### Waltz is a Social Dance. (1)
Social Dances are community activities between humans which is not competition focused within its rules but safety focused within its rules.
### Waltz is a Partner Dance.
Partner Dances are dance activities with two roles where communication occurs between the pair.
### Waltz is full-body physical exercise.
For many, dance as a fun exercise is an important feature of it. While the full body nature might need to be accommodated, it is still important to keep around. (Sidenote however, that while waltz typically includes communication via tension or pressure, there is no communication via textures, and Hand Shapes change occasionally but not drastically.)
### Waltz is a musical experience.
This project is invested in maintaining the rhythmic experience of dance. The dynamics and other musicality experience of Dance are harder to preserve but are still worth preserving.
### Waltz is a spinning dance.
(It comes from an old word for to turn) The founder likes spinning, and would like to keep this feature of the dance.
### Waltz is a traveling dance.
Traveling dances move around a large room.
### Waltz is an improvised dance.
Both combinatorial (different move sequence) and stylistic (different details) improvisation are a part of Waltz.
### Waltz is a signaled dance
Dance moves are led via body movements not words (emergency stops via words are fine).
